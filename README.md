# How to Run the Project

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file at the root level of the project and add the following variables:
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_PUSHER_API_KEY`: Your Pusher API key.
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_LOCAL_SERVER_URL`: The URL of your local server.
3. Ensure you have also cloned and started the server. See instructions at the [PusherExpoServer repository](https://github.com/eylonshm/PusherExpoServer).
4. Run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android` to start the project in your emulator.
5. The app should now run on your simulator. Click the button to test it.
