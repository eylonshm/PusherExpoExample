# How to run the project
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Create a .env file at the root level of the project, add `EXPO_PUBLIC_PUSHER_API_KEY` & `EXPO_PUBLIC_LOCAL_SERVER_URL`.
3. Make sure you also cloned and started the server (please create a .env file there as well).
4. Run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android` to start the project in your emulator.
